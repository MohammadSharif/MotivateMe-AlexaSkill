# Motivate Me

An Alexa skill that reads out a random motivational quote upon request.

## Purpose

This was the first ever Alexa skill I had created and was also the first time I wrote code in Node.js
so to familiarize myself with both the platform and the language I decided to build this app. Although the quotes are
hardcoded currently, I would like to look into parsing quotes online in the near future. An adventure for another day!

## In Progress

I am currently trying to integrate the skill to an RDS database hosted on Amazon Web Services, which will allow for having a database of quotes to randomly pick from that can be updated every once in a while.
